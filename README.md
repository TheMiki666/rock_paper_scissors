ROCK, PAPER OR SCISSORS

This is the exercise number 3 of The Odin Project, course of Fundations.

This game includes the DLC "Rock, paper, scissors, lizard or Spock".

In the code there are two constants you can change:

NUMBER_OF_ROUNDS (line 26, default value=5)
   Select a positive integer number to choose the number of rounds of the game.
   
NUMBER_OF_ROUNDS (line 24, default value=3)
	Set 3 for the regular game, or 5 to activate the DLC and playing with the lizard and Spock.
	Other values shows an error in console and provokes malfunction of the game. 
	Change it at your own risk!
	
	
And I have to admit: I disobeyed the Odin Project advices:
1) I've spend effords on improving this game, instead of saving them for my portfolio.
2) I've originaly made the game in Windows, used Notpad++ as an IDE, and debbuged it with Chrome Developers Tools. The reason is that I had to make this game in another computer, not in mine!

Sorry, Odin, for my sins! I hope the Valhala gates are still open to me!
